            The support that $points has received has been overwhelming. Iâ€™m glad the community has found enjoyment in
            this, but I need to step away. I will not be working on or supporting $points.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is still not a plan for the funds, but they will not be used to support the $points ecosystem. I will
            decide what to do at my sole discretion.
